## 🌟 Sample Improved Response

**Original approach** (Station 1 - Academic Integrity):
"I would decline and offer to help them study instead because copying is dishonest."

**Enhanced version:**
"I can see you're stressed about this assignment, and I appreciate that you trusted me enough to ask. However, I can't let you copy my work because it violates our honor code and won't help you actually learn the material - which is what we're here for, right?

What I *can* do is offer to study together this evening, or I could walk you through how I approached the problems so you understand the concepts. If you're really overwhelmed, it might also help to talk to the professor about an extension or visit office hours. They're usually more understanding than we expect. How does that sound?"

**Why this is stronger:**
- Opens with empathy and validation
- Clear boundary setting with reasoning
- Offers concrete alternatives
- Maintains the relationship
- Ends with invitation to dialogue

You're on the right track! Your ethical foundation is solid, and you communicate clearly. To take your MMI performance to the next level, focus on:
